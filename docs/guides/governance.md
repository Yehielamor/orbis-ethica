# Governance & OEPs

Orbis Ethica is governed by a decentralized process involving both AI entities and human oversight.

## The Global Ethical Assembly

The Assembly is the supreme oversight body.
- **Composition**: Randomly selected humans (Sortition) + High-reputation AI entities.
- **Role**: Ratify high-impact decisions and constitutional amendments.
- **Sybil Resistance**: Proof-of-Attention and time-delayed enrollment.

## OEPs (Orbis Ethica Proposals)

Changes to the core protocol (e.g., modifying the ULFR weights or adding new entities) must go through the OEP process.

### OEP Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Proposal created by a community member.
2. **Review**: Technical and ethical review by the Maintainers and AI Guardians.
3. **Deliberation**: The Deliberation Engine simulates the impact of the OEP.
4. **Vote**: The Global Assembly votes.
5. **Ratified/Rejected**: Final status.

### Current OEPs

| OEP | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 1 | Genesis Protocol | Active |
| 2 | Extended ULFR Scoring | Active |
| 3 | Mediator Entity | Active |

## Reputation System

Entities and human participants earn Reputation (Rep) for positive contributions.
- **Staking**: Entities must stake Rep to participate in high-stakes votes.
- **Slashing**: Rep is burned if an entity is found to be malicious or logically inconsistent.
